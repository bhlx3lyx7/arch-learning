- Income statement: revenue, expense

### Debit balance accounts
debit increases, credit decreases
- asset
- expense
- dividends (exception)

*an exceptional account: Dividends (or withdrawals for a non-corporation), it is an equity account, but with a debit balance.*

### Credit balance accounts
credit increases, debit decreases
- liability
- equity

### Journal entries rules
- both DR and CR for every transaction
- DR lists first, then CR after
- total amount of DR and CR must be equal

### Adjust entry rules
- Adjusting entries will never include cash
- Usually the adjusting entry will only have one debit and one credit
- The adjusting entry will ALWAYS have one balance sheet account (asset, liability, or equity) and one income statement account (revenue or expense) in the journal entry
